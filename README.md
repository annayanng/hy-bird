# hy-bird.

🐤 **What is it?**

hy-bird. is a mobile app that eases the transition from working at home into the office. hy-bird. allows you to complete daily covid check-ins, book desks and meeting rooms, and more! Users are given a questionnaire to fill out to determine the best days for them to come into the office.
